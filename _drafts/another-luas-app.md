# TL;DR
I created a Luas App that does all the things I wanted it to do. You can find it on [https://anotherluasapp.com/](https://anotherluasapp.com/)

-------

In March 2020, at the start of Lockdown 1.0 I wanted to take a look at React. So in the effort to find something interesting to do I dipped into my never ending well of Transport in Dublin and decided to create a app that would provide all the features I felt was missing from other applications.

# The before times
Previously, my default Luas app was [Luas at a Glance](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thecosmicfrog.luasataglance&hl=en&gl=US) by [Aaron Hastings](https://twitter.com/thecosmicfrog?lang=en). It's a fast, simple application that I learned when writing this post is [open source](https://github.com/thecosmicfrog/LuasataGlance).

The main issue I missed from Luas at a Glance was the lack of operating hours. When I was out and planning to get the last Luas home I would use the Luas website to remind myself what time I would need to leave at.

# What I wanted
So that was the first thing I wanted, operating hours.

It's got some nice features that I'm proud of: 
Clock face eleven-thirty
First and last tram information
High voltage sign
Super speedy
‚≠ê
Favorite Stations
Anticlockwise downwards and upwards open circle arrows
Automatic forecast refresh
Bicycle
Station facilities
No entry sign
No ads
