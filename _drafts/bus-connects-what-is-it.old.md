Bus Connects is a plan by the National Transport Agency (NTA) to overhaul several areas of transportation in Dublin. The plan is made up of 10 distinct plans that all share the same branding. I know nothing about branding so maybe this was a good idea, but to me it just looks it caused a bunch of confusion for the general public, with people unable to separate on part of the plan from the others.


Either way, these 10 plans, [in the words of the NTA, are](https://busconnects.ie/about/):

> * Building a network of new bus corridors to make journey's faster and more reliable.
> * New network of cycle lanes/tracks.
> * Redesign of the Dublin area bus network to provide a more efficient network with high frequency spines, new orbital routes and increased bus services.
> * Develop a state-of-the-art ticketing system, including a cashless payment system.
> * Simpler fare structure.
> * New bus stops and shelters with better signage and information
> * Provision of bus based Park and Ride sites in key locations.
> * New bus livery providing a common style across different operators.
> * Transitioning to a new bus fleet with low emission vehicle technologies.

You might know some of these plans from the news, but my goal here is to give a comprehensive list of what each of these plans entails. Some of these plans overlap, but as a whole I tend to think of them as individual plans that would be improved if the others were implemented.

## What it isn't

There is a lot of talk about transport in Ireland at the moment thanks to a large period of little to know investment coming to a head. Bus Connects is a part of the Ireland 2040 plan announced in May 2019, but it does not involve anything other than that listed above. While naturally any improvement in other areas of Dublin's public transport will effect the bus network, new transportation projects like Metrolink, Dart improvements or new LUAS lines are not part of the Bus Connect project.

## The plans

### Redesign of the Bus Network
This is 

### Bus Corridors

The NTA are calling this the [Core Bus Corridor Project](https://busconnects.ie/initiatives/core-bus-corridor-project/) and you might know it from the uproar about trees that are planned to be cut down. <!-- Add links to news articles --> The plan involves creating 16 bus corridors, through a combination creating more dedicated bus lanes (by widening streets, or removing car lanes), and/or bus gates.

TODO:

* Examples of implementations in other parts of the world, their success or failures

#### Why cut down trees

The initial plans for the Core Bus Corridors involved cutting down a significant number of trees along the corridors.

#### What are bus gates

Bus Gates are a short section of a road which only allow buses and specific vehicles through. Private motor vehicles are diverted away from the gate. Bus gates facilitate bus priority ensuring buses can run to schedule.
Under Bus Connects, bus gates are to be used in places where roads are too narrow to allow for cars and buses to travel together.

### Improved Cycle Infrastructure
With the creation of Core Bus Corridors (CBCs) [the NTA would also like to create cycle corridors on the main arteries to the city](https://busconnects.ie/initiatives/on-your-bike/). These cycle lanes will be segregated from both bus and normal traffic, and designed for all users from beginners to experienced cyclists.  

The 200km of cycle corridor would be a start to create a Dutch style cycling infrastructure in the Capital that would allow cyclists to feel safer while travelling.



[The Dublin Cycling Campaign](https://www.dublincycling.com/cycling/who-are-dublin-cycling-campaign) is an independent, voluntary advocacy group who lobby for improved conditions for cyclists. Since the initial draft of the CBCs was published the Dublin Cycling Campaign have been broadly supportive of the plan, while raising specific concerns to the NTA. Some of which including [gaps in cycle routes, island bus stops, and parking protected lanes have been at least partially addressed in the preferred routes that were published in March of this year.](https://www.dublincycling.com/cycling/updated-busconnects-designs-show-promise-cycle-routes-allimproveme) However, they still have some concerns including on CBC16 where cyclists are to be squeezed to keep an extra bus lane.

I'm excited for improved cycling infrastructure, while I rarely cycle in the city, when I do, I feel terrified and hate being passed too closely by drivers. We have seen from the Costal Mobility Route from Blackrock to Sandycove that dedicated, high quality and safe infrastructure will lead to an uptick in usage and encourage people who might not be considered "cyclists" to cycle. One fact, I learned while looking into cycling in the Netherlands was that they only started their cycling revolution in the 1970s so while we are late, we have time. And secondly, apart from the warmer summer months in Amsterdam, [Dublin experiences warmer average days, less rainy days, and less rainfall.](https://weather-averages.co.uk/compare-climate/dublin%2C-ireland/amsterdam%2C-netherlands)

### Improved Ticketing

When I travel to London, I love how simple it is to travel around the city. Being able to tap a contactless card and continue travelling makes moving about so much easier. Ever get on a bus and realise your Leap card has just dipped below zero, and you have no change.

[Bus Connects includes plans](https://busconnects.ie/initiatives/just-the-ticket/) to both simplify ticketing and the move to a cashless system on buses. The NTA say that the "second biggest source of bus delays, after traffic congestion, is the payment process at bus stops", and anecdotally I know when boarding a bus at busy spots it can take what feels like an age to get to the bus driver to say "â‚¬2.15".

In [November 2019](https://www.thejournal.ie/cashless-payments-on-public-transport-4897407-Nov2019/), the NTA issued a market consulataion for Next Generation Ticketing "to advance the implementation of an Account Based Ticketing (ABT) system across the bus, rail and light rail network". The ABT system includes incorporating open payments allowing for: contactless debit and credit cards (incl. Apple Pay and Google Pay); fare changes, like a 90 minute multi modal fare; QR codes that can be read from an app or paper; electronic tokens and identifiers for concessionary fare products (free travel); alternatives for mobile payments like using a Bluetooth "Be-In Be-Out" model.

### Improved Bus Stops and Signage

You may have already seen the updated signage at bus stops. As part of Go-Ahead operating some routes, the signage at bus stops along those routes needed to be updated.

### Cleaner Fleets

NTA want to switch buses in Dublin to a cleaner fleet. At the outset there was uncertainty as to which low emission technology would be used. [In May 2019](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/environment/dublin-bus-takes-delivery-of-first-hybrid-double-decker-vehicles-1.3899918), Dublin Bus took delivery of their first hybrid double-decker vehicles.

Announced under Ireland 2040, no diesel-only public buses will be purchased. In January 2020, [the NTA signed a deal with Alexander Dennis Limited](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/ireland-to-get-its-first-zero-emission-diesel-electric-hybrid-buses-1.4156856) to purchase up to 600 [Enviro400ER](https://www.alexander-dennis.com/products/double-deck-buses-2-axle/enviro400er/) double decker buses, 100 of which will be deployed by the end of 2020, with the remainder over the next 4 and a half years. The set-up allows for 2.5km of continuos electric range.

[Some commentators](https://electrek.co/2020/02/27/ireland-buys-600-hybrid-buses-why-not-fully-electric/), feel Ireland should do more to move to fully electric buses sooner, and I mostly agree. I think moving to a hybrid approach is a good stop gap, and it will allow for cleaner buses to be rolled out sooner, while we wait for both a more complete charging infrastructure to be developed and the price of electric only buses to reduce.

If you are interested, the [Department of Transportation commissioned a report on *Low-Emersion Bus Trials*](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/7251e2-low-emission-bus-trials-report/). It compares the current diesel fleet with compressed natural gas, hybrid, electric and selective catalytic reduction technology on diesel buses. Some findings include (as you might expect) that fully electric buses are the most energy efficient, and emit the fewest (none) CO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>x</sub> emissions. While cost to purchase an electric bus is almost double that of a diesel bus, and 1.35 times more expensive than hybrid, the cost benefit analysis still recommends that electric should be given priority.

One interesting fact from the Department's report is that the typical Dublin Bus vehicle travels 57,000km a year, that is almost 1.5 times the circumference of the Earth (~40,000km).

### New Livery

If you have seen a Go-Ahead operated bus you will have already seen this new livery. The buses are predominantly blue and yellow and branded Transport for Ireland. For the time being, [Dublin Bus will continue to operate with it's existing livery](https://www.nationaltransport.ie/news/customer-notice-about-new-bus-service-175-from-citywest-to-ucd/).

<!-- TODO: Learn more about NTA privatisation" -->

The new bus livery will be used on commuter bus services too, with some Go-Ahead operated commuter services in Kildare already sporting the look.

### New Park and Rides

The best way to reduce traffic congestion in Dublin, is to reduce the amount of cars in the city. The NTA want to encourage those who are travelling longer distances to drive part way, but then use public transport to complete their journey.

Building on the current Park and Ride infrastructure around Dublin (like the M3 parkway, or the LUAS Red Cow park and ride), the NTA plan places park and ride facilities on the main corridors into Dublin.

[![Map of Dublin area showing indicative locations of park and ride facilities](/assets/images/indicative-locations-of-park-ride-facilities.png)](/assets/images/indicative-locations-of-park-ride-facilities.png)

The park and ride infrastructure would build on the top of the redesigned bus network and the high frequency bus services along the spines. Parking charges and bus fares would be integrated to allow for seamless connections.
