BusConnects is a wide ranging plan by the National Transport Agency (NTA) to overhaul several areas of transportation across the country.

The plan has [nine initiatives](https://busconnects.ie/about/):
* Redesigning the bus network
* Building new bus corridors and cycle lanes
* Implementing a state of the art ticketing system
* Implementing a cashless payment system
* Simpler fare structure
* New bus livery
* New bus stops and shelters
* New Park & Ride sites in key locations
* Transitioning to a new zero emissions bus fleet

Due to this unified branding, things can be confusing. I'm hoping to help answer some of the most common issues.

# Why is the bus network changing?
Pre-BusConnects the network in Dublin had a number of issues. Routes would generally go through the city centre, with few orbital routes; there were numerous routes that share a road for sections of their routes; and, there was little integration with other modes.

The network encourage point to point travel, with people waiting for a specific bus and being unwilling to transfer buses. Mainly due to the unreliability of connections.

# What is changing?
The system in Dublin is changing to focus on 8 lettered spines (A-H) which will each be made up of several routes. Each spine will have all day, frequent service along the core shared section. At the end of the shared section each route will branch out to serve different areas.

The redesign also adds a number of orbital routes (N, W, S, O) which will allow people to travel around the city instead of being forced to take a bus into the city centre and then another out to their destination.

There is also a new city bound, local, peak only and express routes, to cover the service.

# Why is my route changing?
Most routes are being changed as part of the redesign. While the route you usually take might change, most likely there is a replacement route either from the same bus stop or nearby.

[There is a great website that compares the existing and final design of the network](http://sandbox.kevin.ie/busconnects_compare/)

# Why are the gardens being destroyed, and trees being cut down?
There has been [numerous](https://council.ie/new-bus-corridors-will-reduce-travel-times-impact-1300-gardens/) [articles](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/nearly-350-homes-will-lose-part-of-their-gardens-in-busconnects-plan-1.3697852) about gardens being lost due to BusConnects.
