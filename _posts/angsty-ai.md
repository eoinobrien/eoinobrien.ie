Along with half the world I tried [DeepSeek](https://www.deepseek.com/) R1 recently. It was my first experience with a reasoning LLM and I found reading the reasoning output of the model to be, at times, hilarious.

In one of my test, seeing the model trying to reason about what to do when I asked it to no longer reply to my comment led to the below interaction.

My prompt:

> No need to provide any more answers thanks

DeepSeek's response:

>> Thought for 3 seconds  
>>
>> *Alright, the user initially asked for a sequence counting to 1000 with increments of 4, but every third number should be the sum of the two preceding numbers. I provided a detailed answer with the sequence and explanations. They thanked me, and I gave a final answer with key patterns and examples.*
>> 
>> *Now, the user says, "No need to provide any more answers thanks." I need to make sure I respect their request. They might have received the information they needed and don't require further elaboration. I should acknowledge their message without adding any additional content. Maybe they found the answer sufficient or perhaps they want to end the conversation here. Either way, it's important to comply and ensure they know their request is understood. A simple confirmation like "Understood!" should suffice. Itâ€™s polite and lets them know Iâ€™ve noted their preference to stop here. No need to add anything else unless they come back with more questions later. Just keeping it concise and respectful.*

> Understood! Let me know if you need anything else in the future. ğŸ˜Š

Turns out deep down AI is just an angsty teenager.
